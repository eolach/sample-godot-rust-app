# Introduction

**Sample Godot Rust App** is a community project which aims to provide a beginner-friendly Rust/GDNative boilerplate project with pre-configured multi-platform continuous integration.

By introducing GDNative, Godot Engine can load third-party code which can be written in any language, using shared libraries. Thanks to the `gdnative` crate, GDNative can support Rust language, which grants performance, memory safety and concurrency.
